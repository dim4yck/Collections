# Collections
Comparison of collections

Goal: To make a comparison on the speed of List, ArrayList and LinkedList.

Create List, ArrayList and LinkedList collections. Using the for loop, add 1,000,000 elements to each (1,2,3,...).
Using Stopwatch.Start() and Stopwatch.Stop(), measure the duration of filling each collection and display the values on the screen.
Find the 496753rd element, measure the duration of this search and display it on the screen. Display each element of the collection,
which is completely divisible by 777. Print the duration of this operation for each collection.
